## Example Case Studies

* [Salt](https://getsalt.ai/)
  * Salt ($33M A16Z Seed round, founders of MySpace) is a visual development platform for teams to build AI faster in an open ecosystem designed for scale
  * Seeded the entire initial team with 5+ Eventum ML Engineers and 1 ML Product Manager
    * Model fine-tuning
    * Perplexity like search
    * Audio visualization
    * LLM Agents
    * Image upscaling
  * A senior ML Manager on our team in SF helped get the initial product and research off the ground
* [Storia](storia.ai)
  * Storia (YC startup) building an AI expert for the worlds code
    * We helped with ML talent to rapidly iterate on the product
    * Fine-tuning (LLMs, stable-diffusion) and model capability R&D
* [Sanas.ai](sanas.ai)
  * Sanas (Series B, $75M Raised) is building accent-removal for call centers
  * 6+ Eventum ML Engineers helped with:
    * MLOps
      * Implemented ETL system with [Dagster](dagster.io) to automate extremely manual data and ML processes, saving a huge amount of developer time
        * Eventum is one of [Dagster's Trusted Partners](https://dagster.io/partners)
          * Dagster is our current recommended software for all ETL needs
      * Custom CI/CD on windows machines
      * Cloud cost optimization
    * Audio Research and Development
      * Assisted R&D for neural network model improvements
    * Testimonial from Shawn Zhang, CTO, Founder:
      * _“Eventum came in and quenched our MLOps fire in quick order ensuring our ML Scientists could make rapid progress.  We then immediately hired them to help build us a generative AI audio model from scratch”
* [Nouns](nouns.wtf)
  * Nouns ($30M+ treasury, largest DAO)
  * Eventum ML Engineers helped develop RokoAI

  * We worked with them on:
    * Rebuilding their entire computer vision training pipeline from scratch
    * Rebuilding their ML training job submission system from scratch
    * R&D
      * Decreased labeling requirements by >90% using self-supervised learning
      * Decreased mean error of neural network predictions by >40%
* [GenerativeAlpha](galpha.ai)
  * GAlpha (Series A) is making LLM agents to automate investment research and decisions in stock and crypto markets
  * We've worked with them on:
    * Deep learning and classical ML for financial time-series modeling
    * Fine-tuning LLMs to better reason about the news
    * MLOps
      * Multi-cloud ML job submission system
